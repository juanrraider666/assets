          When you reach the arriving terminal after landing in Cancun you will be guided to the immigration hall where you will form a line and wait for your turn with a Mexican Immigration officer. This officer will ask you for your passport, entry visa, if you are from a country which requires it <a class="bw" href="https://embamex.sre.gob.mx/australia/images/pdf/solicitudvisaingles.pdf" target="_blank">(https://embamex.sre.gob.mx/australia/images/pdf/solicitudvisaingles.pdf)</a>, and your tourist card, which will be given to you aboard the plane. The immigration officer may ask you a few questions as of the purpose of your trip, how long you will be staying and if this is your first time in Mexico.
The "tourist card" is a form that the airline will give you at the counter when you check in or aboard the plane. It is one per person, meaning that each member of your party must have one with his/her individual information. Questions in this form include: Names, country of origin, passport number (if you carry one), place where you staying in Mexico, arrival and departure dates and so forth. After the immigration officer has stamped this card you <span class="red_txt medium_txt">MUST keep it in a safe place and do not lose it. you will be asked for this document when you depart Mexico.</span> Although very rare, you might be held in Mexico if you lose your tourist card, so please make sure you do not lose it, keep it in a safe place and have it ready at your departure.<br>
<br>

<span class="red_txt medium_txt">You do not have to carry these documents with you while in Mexico. We recommend you leave them at your hotel in a safe place.</span>
            
             <div class="dark_blue_txt mb-2 s24 medium_txt mt-4">Cancun Customs</div>
            
           During the inbound flight, you will receive and need to fill out a customs form (Hacienda). After passing through immigration, you collect your bags and proceed to the exit. You will hand the form to the customs agent and press the button on what looks like a traffic light.<br>
<br>

A green light means "go" and red means "inspection" in which case, officials perform a quick inspection.<br>
<br>

As a rule of thumb you are allowed to bring into Mexico whatever you need for the time period you will be staying in Mexico. You are not allowed to bring food, fruits and/or products that are not "company" packed and sealed. And if you are bringing food or products they are allowed only if you need them because of a special diet or for medical reasons.
The same rule applies to medicine. You are allowed to bring enough medicine for the time period you will be in Mexico. If you are bringing an unusual quantity of medicine please bring a doctor's prescription just in case you need to prove the medicine is for your own consumption.
